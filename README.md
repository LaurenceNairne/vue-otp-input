# A simple OTP input component built using Vue 3, TypeScript and Vite

This is a simple project to familiarise myself with the structure of Vue 3 as a framework.

## Run
1. Open the repo at the root directory in an IDE/Editor of choice
2. Execute `yarn run dev` in a terminal
3. Open a browser and navigate to the URL returned by Vite in the build logs
